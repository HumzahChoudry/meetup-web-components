# foundation-react
Meetup React library of Foundation components.

## Getting started

### Storybook
Before building any components, it's helpful to know what related components
have already been built into our Foundation library. We use
[React Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook)
to display components outside of the app context. To open it, run:

```sh
$ npm run storybook
```

And open the viewer at [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)

All of the available components are listed on the left, and clicking on
one will open it in the preview pane. Variants are also listed in the left
column to show how different states affect the rendered component.
